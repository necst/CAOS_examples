# CAOS\_example\_applications
This repository hosts a set of example applications that can be accelerated on FPGA-based system via the [CAOS Framework](http://caos.necst.it/).

Furthermore, in the **module_integration** folder, it is possible to find the instructions and templates to create a custom code for the CAOS Framework.

Introductory slides on CAOS are also available [here](https://github.com/necst/CAOS_examples/CAOS-intro.pdf).
